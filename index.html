					    <h3>2d Platformer Game (Currently in development)</h3>
				<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/platformer.png" alt="Stealth Wolf" /></a>
				<p>You go through random levels until you reach a boss. It's currently planned to have five different Acts. Each Act will contain three levels. Each level will contain three stages. Did you get that? 
				Each Act will have it's own theme. Spoiler alert: The first act will have a forest theme to it. Once you complete all three levels in the Act, you will reach a boss. Each boss will drop something unique
				to help you advance through the other acts. This game may possibly turn into a rougelike/rougelite. Stay tuned. :)</p>
				<p>Will you have what it takes to reach the end? Find out once the game comes out! Follow me on my <a href="#footer">social media</a> to see progress updates!</p>
				<p>Release date: TBA</p>
				
						<p>Disclaimer: The game may be subject to change throughout its development.</p>

						<h3>My background</h3>
						<p>I am an aspiring indie game developer. I always wanted to create my own games ever since I was a little kid.
					My dream would be able to make a living off of making games. Some of my favorite game genres are role playing games (RPG), first person shooters (FPS), open world, 
					rouge-like/lite, adventure, and sandbox games. There are also some games I enjoy that don't particually fall into one of those categories. Some of my favorite games
					include Terraria, Minecraft, Old School RuneScape, Vagante, Borderlands series, Metro series, and many more! A lot of these games I play is what inspires me to make my own game.</p>
					<h3>Game History</h3>
					<p>(work in progress)</p>
					<h3>Other Info</h3>
					<p>I'm currently taking college classes right now. I wish to be done will college in the next few years. I also have a cat named Patrick. Thank you for reading. :)</p>
